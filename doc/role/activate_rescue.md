# Activate rescue role
The activate rescue role simply restarts the server ahd activates the rescue mode in order to install the proper image to the server.

```yml
---
- name: First restart the server in case Rescue mode is enabled wrongly
  uri:
    url: "{{ hetzner.hardware_reset_url }}"
    method: POST
    user: "{{ hetzner.user }}"
    password: "{{ hetzner.password }}"
    body_format: form-urlencoded
    body:
      type: hw
  

- name: Wait 30s and continue with play
  wait_for:
    timeout: 30

- name: Activate Rescue mode if is not activated 
  uri: 
    url: "{{ hetzner.rescue_url }}"
    method: POST
    user: "{{ hetzner.user }}"
    password: "{{ hetzner.password }}"
    body_format: form-urlencoded
    body:
      os: linux
      arch: 64
      authorized_key: "{{ hetzner.fingerprint }}" 
 
- name: Reboot server after Rescue Mode activation
  uri:
    url: "{{ hetzner.hardware_reset_url }}"
    method: POST
    user: "{{ hetzner.user }}"
    password: "{{ hetzner.password }}"
    body_format: form-urlencoded
    body:
      type: hw

- name: Wait for server to be ready
  wait_for:
    port: 22 
    host: "{{ target }}" 
    connect_timeout: 20
    delay: 20
    timeout: 500 
```

All the steps are self explanatory so no extra info is needed.

In order to run this role we need a file with the vars used. In this case we need a vars/main.yml file with this structure:

```yml
server_ip: ip
hetzner:
  user: "hetzner_user"
  password: "hetzner_password"
  rescue_url: "https://robot-ws.your-server.de/boot/{{ server_ip }}/rescue"
  fingerprint: "pubkey_fingerprint"
  hardware_reset_url: "https://robot-ws.your-server.de/reset/{{ server_ip }}"
```


When you add a public key to the Hetzner Robot control panel, Hetzner associates a **fingerprint** with that public key. That's the one you have to put in the fingerprint var.

Highly recommended to encrypt this type of var files with ansible vault:

```bash
    ansible-vault encrypt roles/activate_rescue/vars/main.yml --vault-pass=.vault_pass.txt
```

The file **.vault_pass.txt** must contain the string with the password to encrypt/decrypt.
